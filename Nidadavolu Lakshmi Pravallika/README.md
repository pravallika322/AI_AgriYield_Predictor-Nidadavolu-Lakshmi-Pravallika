Title
AgriYield Predictor - Forecasting Crop Yield Using Environmental and Soil Data

Objective

1.Develop a machine learning system to predict crop yield based on environmental and soil parameters like rainfall, temperature, humidity, soil type, and nutrient content.
2.Help farmers and planners optimize crop production.

Outcomes

1.Data preprocessing and feature engineering on agricultural datasets.
2.Training and evaluating regression models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression).
3.Model performance comparison and explainability (using SHAP values).
4.Deliver a functional prototype with yield predictions based on user input or uploaded data.

Dataset Sources

1.FAO Crop Production Dataset (crop yield data by region).
2.Kaggle Agriculture datasets (environmental and soil data by region).
3.Indian Government Open Agriculture Data Portal.
4.Weather and soil data from public sources like Kaggle, NOAA, Open Weather Map APIs.
